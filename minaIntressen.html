              Couldn't Stand the Weather is the second studio album by American
              blues rock band Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. It was
              released on May 15, 1984, by Epic Records as the follow-up to the
              band's critically and commercially successful 1983 album, Texas
              Flood. Recording sessions took place in January 1984 at the Power
              Station in New York City. Stevie Ray Vaughan wrote half the tracks
              on Couldn't Stand the Weather. The album went to No. 31 on the
              Billboard 200 chart and the music video for "Couldn't Stand the
              Weather" received regular rotation on MTV. The album received
              mostly positive reviews, with AllMusic giving it a four out of
              five stars. It received praise for Vaughan’s playing and
              highlighted songs such as Voodoo Child and Tin Pan Ally, but
              received criticism for the lack of original songs and
              forgetability of some of the songs. In 1999, a reissue of the
              album was released which contains an audio interview segment and
              four studio outtakes. In 2010, the album was reissued again as the
              Legacy Edition containing two CDs with a previously unreleased
              studio outtake and an August 17, 1984 concert at The Spectrum in
              Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

          <h3>Jimi Hendrix - Are You Experienced</h3>

            <p>
              Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by the Jimi Hendrix
              Experience. Released in 1967, the LP was an immediate critical and
              commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the
              greatest debuts in the history of rock music. The album features
              Jimi Hendrix's innovative approach to songwriting and electric
              guitar playing which soon established a new direction in
              psychedelic and hard rock music. By mid-1966, Hendrix was
              struggling to earn a living playing the R&B circuit as a backing
              guitarist. After being referred to Chas Chandler, who was leaving
              the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists,
              Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with
              Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought
              Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band, the
              Jimi Hendrix Experience, designed to showcase the guitarist's
              talents. In late October, after having been rejected by Decca
              Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by
              the Who's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. Are You
              Experienced and its preceding singles were recorded over a
              five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967.
              The album was completed in 16 recording sessions at three London
              locations, including De Lane Lea Studios, CBS Studios, and Olympic
              Studios. Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, Are You Experienced
              spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. The album was
              issued in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records, where it reached
              number five on the US Billboard Top LPs, remaining on the chart
              for 106 weeks, 27 of those in the Top 40. The album also spent 70
              weeks on the US Billboard Hot R&B LPs chart, where it peaked at
              number 10. The US version contained some of Hendrix's best known
              songs, including the Experience's first three singles, which,
              though omitted from the British edition of the LP, were top ten
              hits in the UK: "Purple Haze", "Hey Joe", and "The Wind Cries
              Mary". In 2000, it was voted number 63 in Colin Larkin's All Time
              Top 1000 Albums.[1] Rolling Stone ranked Are You Experienced 30th
              on its 2020 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The
              magazine placed four songs from the album on their list of the 500
              Greatest Songs of All Time: "Purple Haze" (17), "Foxy Lady" (153),
              "Hey Joe" (201), and "The Wind Cries Mary" (379). That same year,
              the record was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of
              Congress in recognition of its cultural significance to be added
              to the National Recording Registry. Writer and archivist Reuben
              Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: "it's still a
              landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&B, blues ...
              musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music ... in a way
              I compare to James Joyce's Ulysses."[2]
